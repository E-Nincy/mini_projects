# Define the set of allowed user input options (e.g., "go", "take", "fight", "inventory", "quit")

# Create a dictionary to store player's inventory (e.g., empty at the beginning)

# Define the rooms:
# Each room has a name, a description, and optionally:
# - an item to collect
# - an opponent to fight
# - directions to other rooms

# Start in the initial room

# Game loop begins
    # Show current room name and description
    # If the room has an item and it's not yet collected, allow the player to collect it
    # If the room has an opponent:
        # Ask the player if they want to fight or run
        # If they choose to fight:
            # Check if they have needed items to fight
            # Use the random module to simulate a dice roll or random multiplier
            # Decide win/loss based on inventory + randomness
            # If they lose:
                # Empty the inventory
                # Maybe return them to a previous room
    # Ask the player what they want to do next (e.g., go north, check inventory, quit)
    # Process input and move to the next room or execute action

# End the game if player quits or dies
